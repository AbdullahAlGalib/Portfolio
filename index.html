                    The sample app includes code to simulate server responses. When building an Exposure Notifications app based on this project, create a server environment to provide diagnosis keys and exposure criteria, and add code to your app to communicate with this server. If the app you build operates in a country that authenticates medical tests for COVID-19, you may need to include additional network code to communicate with those authentication services
